Fixed an issue where ``frozenlist`` binary wheels would be built with debugging symbols and line tracing enabled, which significantly impacted performance. Line tracing is now disabled by default and can only be enabled explicitly -- by :user:`bdraco`.

This change ensures that production builds are optimized for performance. Developers who need line tracing for debugging purposes can still enable it by:

1. Setting the ``FROZENLIST_CYTHON_TRACING`` environment variable
2. Using the ``--config-setting=with-cython-tracing=true`` option with pip
