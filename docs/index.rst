frozenlist
==========

A list-like structure which implements
:class:`collections.abc.MutableSequence`.

The list is *mutable* until :meth:`FrozenList.freeze` is called,
after which list modifications raise :exc:`RuntimeError`. A
:class:`FrozenList` instance is hashable, but only when frozen.
Attempts to hash a non-frozen instance will result in a
:exc:`RuntimeError` exception.

API
---

.. class:: frozenlist.FrozenList(items)

   Construct a new *non-frozen* list from *items* iterable.

   The list implements all :class:`collections.abc.MutableSequence`
   methods plus two additional APIs.

   .. attribute:: frozen

      A read-only property, ``True`` is the list is *frozen*
      (modifications are forbidden).

   .. method:: freeze()

      Freeze the list. There is no way to *thaw* it back.


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install frozenlist

The library requires Python 3.6 or newer.
